The Value of Life in Legal Context
==================================

Survey and Critiques
--------------------

by W. Kip Viscusi (2000), in American Law and Economics Association.

Week 04, February 29, 2016. Topic: Value of Statistical Life

Main questions:
---------------

> - Appropriate value of life to establish **efficient incentives
 for safety for deterrence and accident prevention**?
- What is the appropriate value of life from the standpoint of 
the principles of optimal insurance and appropriate compensation
of accident victims?
- If our objective is to make the victim whole, as in tort liability
context involving nonmonetary damages, what should be the appropriate
level of compensation?
- If the regulatory expenditures to save lives are very unproductive,
is there any level at which their effect on risk leads to the loss of
statistical life rather than a health benefit?

Measures
--------

- 	Value of statistical lives

	What is that person's willingness to pay to eliminate some small risk
	of death? (WTP of those affected by the risk reduction in the context of
	policies)

	This is appropriate for deterrence rather than compensation.

- 	Insurance and human capital measures

	The present value of the earnings of the individual exposed to the risk.
	
	This measure is more appropriate for insurance and compensation to the
	accident victim.
	
-	The Make Whole Principle
	
	Make the victim "whole" after an economic loss by compensating for the
	value of the loss that has been incurred. This approach not only provides
	for full compensation of the loss but also establishes appropriate
	incentives for accident avoidance in situations in which all accident
	losses are monetary. [...] Optimal insurance will provide for sufficient
	compensation to equate the marginal utililty of income in both the
	accident and the marginal utility of income in both the accident and the
	no accident state of the world.
	
	[...] If there is no such diminution in marginal utility, then the total
	value of the compensation an accident victim receives for the financial
	loss plus any pain and suffering compensation should be sufficient to make
	the victim whole.
	
	[...] There is consequently no economic justification for levels of
	postaccident insruance compensation that will restore the fatally injured
	or seriously impaired accident victims to their preaccident welfare level.
	
-	Risk-Risk analysis

	Regulations may create risks as well as reduce them. In some cases, there
	may be direct risk effects of the regulation. "Risks caused by regulations."
	
	Health-health analysis [based on this](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457501000847): Expenditure
	on a particular health policy or safety regulation must be financed in one way
	or another, which will results in an opportunity cost or income effect leaving
	less resources for other health and safety promoting activities in society.
	Thus, we will have an effect that reduxces safety and health benefits induced
	by that income loss. [...] One way of esimating the income loss that induces
	one death, which we call the value of an induced death (VOID), is to estimate
	it as a multiple of the traditional value to acert a statistical death, also
	named the value of a statistical life (VOSL).

Value of statistical lives
--------------------------

Supposed that we had 10,000 respondents, each of whom faced a 1/10,000 risk of
death. Overall, there would be one statistical death expected in this group. If
each person is willing to pay $500 to eliminate the risk, a total of $5 million
coould be raised to eliminate the one statistical death to the entire group. Thus,
$5 million would be the value of a statistical life in this situation.

[...] Smith suggested that workers would need to be compensated for jobs that posed
additional risk; otherwise, these positions would not be as attractive as safer job
alternatives. - Graphical example on the trade off of the wage and risk of a job.
(XX curve - from the market optimums vs. individual preferences - they provide
different risk compensation rates for a given person)

Regulatory Applications of the Value of Life
---------------------------------------------

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget now recommends the use of the value of
life methodology for benefit assessment for all proposed federal regulations. While
agencies now routinely assess benefits using these value of life figures, the result of
the analysis do not always bind government policy. In most instances, the restrictive
legislative mandates of the regulatory agencies require that they issues protective
regulations irrespective of benefit-cost balancing. [...] The different cost per life
for U.S. policies.

### Salient policy issues

Heterogeneity in the value of life should be incorporated in the calculations as well
given the context of the regulations. Value of life may differ based on:

- 	individual age: the value of the years that are gained because of the risk
	reduction differs on the actual age.
-	income: WTP is different for different income groups (however, government imposed
	distinctions would be controversial - a consumer borne solution would be more fit)
-	quality of life years at risk and the whether the risks are voluntary.

Questions
---------

- 	As the paper points out, the value of statistical life can be different if ceteris
	paribus the income is different. This would mean that the same policy reducing
	the health issues from environment degradation by tackling the pollution can be 
	efficient based on a cost-benefit analysis in a developed country while not
	efficient in a developing country. Does this mean that the value of the environment
	is lower in the developing country than in the developed country?

-	Given this problem and that these calculations based on the value statistical life
	(WTP) are susceptible to underestimate future generations valuations (as described
	in the paper) is it rational for the US. regulatory bodies to issue protective
	regulations regardless the implications of the cost-benefit analyses?
