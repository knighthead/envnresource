Introduction
------------ 

Because of the leak caused by rupture in the hull of the Exxon Valdez, 11 
million gallons of oil was released into the Prince William Sound. Before the 
case, the concept of nonuse value was not really known besides economist working 
in the area of benefit cost analysis. [...] It is generally recognized that 
stated preference methods are applicable to the estimation of passive use value, 
which entails no direct involvement with natural resources. 

Contingent valuation circumvents the absence of markets for natural resource 
services by presenting consumers with a choice situation in which they have the 
opportunity to buy or sell services in question. 

Main points of the paper
------------------------

In order to asses the willingness to pay for the preventive measures of further
oil spills in the Prince William Sound area, a carefully designed survey was
developed and used in the whole U.S. The main objects of the survey was to:

*	measure only the specified set of injuries;
*	be consistent with economic theory (by elicitng an approximation of monetized
	loss in utility suffered by the respondents as a result of the injuries 
	casued by the spill);
*	be comprehensive and comprehensible for everyine;
*	be plausible with respect to the payment vehicle;
*	be neutral;
*	be conservative in the estimation of WTP.

The main design issues that were tackled in the survey design are the following:

*	Elicitation method: binary discrete question  is incentive
	compatible [1]_, but in the survey, there is another question based on the
	response to the last one.
*	Choice of payment vehicle: instead of the higher price of a wider range of
	goods and high oil prices (given the expected hectic oil price), higher taxes
	are selected. Moreover, the tax increment is collected in one-sum.
*	"Embedding": instead of the sequential valuation of more goods, only one
	good will be considered (according to economic theory, because of the
	substitution and income effects, the later in a WTP sequence a normal good
	is valued, the lower the value is).
	
[...] skipping the further structure of the survey and the execution (probabilistic
sampling was used).
	
Using the responses to the survey, the authors first established in which range
the WTP is for a given respondent (both for one question and the two question
version), then relying on survival analysis and on the Turnbull nonparametric
and Weibull distribution approaches they produce the empirical distribution of
the WTPs. This is important in order to establish the *mean* WTP of the sample
(and thus an estimation of the mean population WTP), which is $53.6 for the
former and $79.2 for the latter approach. Then, the authors estimate a valuation
function of WTP based on the characteristics available on the respondents in
order to make adjustments on the estimate of the *median* WTP and to perform
sensibility tests. This estimate allows the authors to estimate mean
WTPs for respondents conditional on their characteristics.

These estimates eventually produces an aggregate lost passive value of $4.78
billion in the conservative case (Turnbull approach) and $7.19 billion by the
Weibull approach. These estimates are way higher than the one established by the
original study, which is $2.8 billion. These figures reflect the public's WTP to
prevent another oil spill.

		is  actually preferred or saying "no" otherwise.
