<h1>Collective Action and the Evolution of Social Norms<a class="headerlink" href="#collective-action-and-the-evolution-of-social-norms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>80
Based on Mancur Olson, the zero contribution thesis says that &#8220;[U]nless the
number of individuals in a group is quite small, or unless there is coercion or
some other special device to make individuals act in their common interest,
rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or
group interests.&#8221; However, the thesis contradicts observations of everyday life.
Extensive fieldwork has by now established that individuals in all walks of life
and all parts of the world voluntarily organize themselves so as to gain the
benefits of trade, to provide mutual protection against risk, and to create and
enforce rules that protect natural resources.</p>
<p>This paper will describe both avenues of research on the underpinnings of
collective action, first focusing on the experimental evidence and potential
theoretical explanations, and then on the real-world empirical evidence. A
central finding is that the world contains multiple types of individuals, some
more willing than others to initiate reciprocity to achieve the benefits of
collective action. Thus, a core question is how potential cooperators signal one
another and design institutions that reinforce rather than destroy conditional
cooperation. Evolutionary theories appear most able to explain the diverse
findings.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Evidence on Rational Choice in Collective Action Situations<a class="headerlink" href="#laboratory-evidence-on-rational-choice-in-collective-action-situations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Usually, political economists assume rational individuals since experiments
based on this can robustly demonstrate that microeconomic theory holds in
explaining market behaviour. However, this assumption does not yield expected
results in collective action situations - e.g. linear public good experiments
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Since the first public good experimetns were undertake, there were many others
uner various conditions successfully replicating the following findings (which
can be considered as core facts by now):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Subjects contribute between 40 and 60 percent of their endowments to the
public good in a one-shot game as well as in the first round of finitely repeated
games.</li>
<li>After the first round, contribution levels tend to decay downward, but
remain well above zero. A repeated finding is that over 70 percent of subjects
contribute nothing in the announced last round of a finitely repeated sequence.</li>
<li>Those who believe others will cooperate in social dilemmas are more likely
to cooperate themselves. A rational egoist in a public good game, however, should
not in any way be affected by a belief regarding the contribution levels of others.
The dominant strategy is a zero contribution no matter what others do.</li>
<li>In general, learning the game better tends to lead to more cooperation, not
less.</li>
<li>Face-to-face communication in a public good game-as well as in other
types of social dilemmas-produces substantial increases in cooperation that
are sustained across all periods including the last period. The strong
effect of communication is not consistent with currently accepted
theory, because verbal agreements in these experiments are not enforced.</li>
<li>When the structure of the game allows it, subjects will expend personal
resources to punish those who make below-average contributions to a
collective benefit, including the last period of a finitely repeated game.</li>
<li>The rate of contribution to a public good is affected by various contextual
factors including the framing of the situation and the rules used for assigning
participants, increasing competition among them, allowing communication, authorizing
sanctioning mechanisms, or allocating benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p>These facts are hard to explain using the standard theory that all individuals
who face the same objective game structure evaluate decisions in the same way!</p>

<h2>Building a Theory of Collective Action with Multiple Types of Players<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-theory-of-collective-action-with-multiple-types-of-players" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Assuming two types of &#8220;norm-using&#8221; (conditional cooperators and willing
punishers) players is useful. Conditional cooperators are individuals who are
willing to initiate cooperative action when they estimate others will
reciprocate and to repeat these actions as long as a sufficient proportion of
the others involved reciprocate. Conditional cooperators are the source of the
relatively high levels of contributions in one-shot or initial rounds of
prisoner&#8217;s dilemma and public good games. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The first four findings are consistent with an assumption that conditional
cooperators are involved in most collective action situations. Knowing the
number of repetitions will be relatively long, conditional cooperators can
restrain their disappointment with free riders and keep moderate levels of
cooperation (and joint payoffs) going for ever-longer periods of time. The fifth
and sixth findings depend on the presence of a third type of player who is
willing, if given an opportunity, to punish presumed free riders through verbal
rebukes or to use costly material payoffs when available.</p>
<p>Together, conditional cooperators and willing punishers create a more robust
opening for collective action and a mechanism for helping it grow. When allowed
to communicate on a face-to-face basis, willing punishers convey a considerable
level of scorn and anger toward others who have not fully reciprocated their
trust and give substantial positive encouragement when cooperation rates are
high. Even more important for the long-term sustainability of collective action
is the willingness of some to pay a cost to sanction others.</p>
<p>How could these norm-using types of players have emerged and survived in a world
of rational egoists?</p>

<h2>Emergence and Survival of Multiple Types of Players in Evolutionary Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#emergence-and-survival-of-multiple-types-of-players-in-evolutionary-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a strict evolutionary model, individuals inherit strategies and do not change
strategies in their lifetime. In this approach, those carrying the more
successful strategies for an environment reproduce at a higher rate.</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychologists who study the cognitive structure of the human brain
conclude that humans do not develop general analytical skills that are then
applied to a variety of specific problems. Rather, the human brain appears to
have evolved a domain-specific, human-reasoning architecture. The deontic effect
in human reasoning has repeatedly been detected even in children as young as
three years old and is not associated with overall intelligence or educational
level of the subject. Thus, <strong>recent developments in evolutionary theory and
supporting empirical research provide strong support for the assumption that
modern humans have inherited a propensity to learn social norms</strong>, similar to
our inherited propensity to learn grammatical rules.</p>

<h2>The Indirect Evolutionary Approach to Adaptation Through Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#the-indirect-evolutionary-approach-to-adaptation-through-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recent work on an indirect evolutionary approach <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a> to the study of human
behavior offers a rigorous theoretical approach for understanding how preferences-
including those associated with social norms-evolve or adapt. An indirect
evolutionary approach explains how a mnixture of norm-users and rational egoists
would emerge in settings where standard rational choice theory assumes the
presence of rational egoists alone.</p>
<p>In this approach, social norms may lead individuals to behave differently in the
same objective situation depending on how strongly they value conformance with
(or deviance from) a norm. With complete information regarding types, conditional
cooperators playing a trustworthy strategy will more frequently receive the
higher payoff, while rational egoists will consistently receive a lower payoff,
since others will not trust them. Only the trustworthy type would survive in an evolutionary process with complete information. 386). Viewed as a cultural
evolutionary process, new entrants to the population would be more likely to
adopt the preference ordering of those who obtained the higher material payoffs
in the immediate past.</p>
<p>If there is no information about player types for a relatively large population,
preferences will evolve so that only rational egoists survive. On the other hand,
if there is a noisy signal about a player&#8217;s type that is at least more accurate
than random, trustworthy types will survive as a substantial proportion of the
population.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evidence-testing-the-indirect-evolutionary-approach">
<h2>Evidence Testing the Indirect Evolutionary Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#evidence-testing-the-indirect-evolutionary-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An indirect evolutionary approach is able to explain how a mixture of contingent
cooperators and rational egoists would emerge in settings where traditional game
theory predicts that only rational egoists should prevail. Findings confirms
that not all players enter a collective action situation as pure forward-looking
rational egoists who make decisions based solely on individual outcomes. Some
bring with them a set of norms and values that can support cooperation.
In a one-shot, sequential, double-blind prisoner&#8217;s dilemma experiment,
the norms supporting cooperation and reciprocity were diminished, but not
eliminated by experience, although preferences on the outcomes suggested that
social norms supporting cooperation were present.</p>
<p>Based on Cain (1998), nice players chose cooperation in the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma
game 69% of the time when they were paired with other nice players and 39%
of the time when they were paired with and introduced to stingy players.</p>
<p>Finally, interesting experimental (as well as field) evidence has accumulated
that externally imposed rules tend to &#8220;crowd out&#8221; endogenous cooperative
behavior. The removal of the external mechanism &#8220;seemed to undermine subsequent
cooperation and leave the group worse off than those in the control group who
had played a regular . .. prisoner&#8217;s dilemma in both cases with face-to-face
communication. Studies show that communication between the parties can work as
well or nearly as well at generating cooperative behaviour as an externally
imposed set of rules and system of monitoring and sanctioning. Moreover, norms
seem to have a certain staying power in encouraging a growth of the desire for
cooperative behavior over time, while cooperation enforced by externally imposed
rules can disappear very quickly. Finally, the worst of all worlds may be one
where external authorities impose rules but are only able to achieve weak
monitoring and sanctioning.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Rules and Norms in the Field<a class="headerlink" href="#the-evolution-of-rules-and-norms-in-the-field" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Field studies identified numerous contextual variable that are either conductive
or detrimental to endogenous collective action. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a>
A frequent finding is that when the users of a common-pool resource organize
themselves to devise and enforce some of their own basic rules, they tend to
manage local resources more sustainably than when rules are externally imposed
on them.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-emergence-of-self-organized-collective-action">
<h3>The Emergence of Self-Organized Collective Action<a class="headerlink" href="#the-emergence-of-self-organized-collective-action" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a small core group of users willing to restrict their own use of a common
pool resource identify each other, they can begin a process of cooperation
without having to devise a full-blown organization with all of the rules that
they might eventually need to sustain cooperation over time. The presence of a
leader or entrepreneur, who articulates different ways of organizing to improve
joint outcomes, is frequently an important initial stimulus.</p>

<h3>Design Principles of Long-Surviving, Self-Organized Resource Regimes<a class="headerlink" href="#design-principles-of-long-surviving-self-organized-resource-regimes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Successful self-organized resource regimes can initially draw upon locally
evolved norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness and the likely presence of local
leaders in most community settings. But there are clear design principles that
improve the survival of the resource regime.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>clear boundary rules</strong></dt>
<dd>Using this principle enables participants to know who is in and who
is out of a defined set of relationships and thus with whom to cooperate.</dd>
<dt><strong>restriction and benefit distribution</strong></dt>
<dd>The second design principle is that the local rules-in-use restrict the
amount, timing, and technology of harvesting the resource; allocate benefits
proportional to required inputs; and are crafted to take local conditions
into account. Well-tailored rules help to account for the perseverance of
the resource itself. If some users get all the benefits and pay few of the
costs, others become unwilling to follow rules over time.</dd>
<dt><strong>democractic rule forming</strong></dt>
<dd>The third design principle is that most of the individuals affected by a
resource regime can participate in making and modifying their rules.
Resource regimes that use this principle are both able to tailor better
rules to local circumstances and to devise rules that are considered fair by
participants. People who violate these rules suffer not only a loss
of favor from the animals (important in the Cree ideology of hunting) but
also social disgrace.&#8221; Fair rules of distribution help to build trusting
relationships, since more individuals are willing to abide by these rules
because they participated in their design and also because they meet shared
concepts of fairness.</dd>
<dt><strong>selection and transparency of monitoring</strong></dt>
<dd>The fourth design principle is that most long-surviving resource
regimes select their own monitors, who are accountable to the users or are
users themselves and who keep an eye on resource conditions as well as on
user behavior.</dd>
<dt><strong>graduated sanctions</strong></dt>
<dd>that depend on the seriousness and context of the offense. With the former
priciple, the regime does not have to rely only on willing punishers to
impose personal costs on those who break a rule. On the other hand, the
initial sanctions that are imposed are often so low as to have no impact
on an expected benefit-cost ratio of breaking local rules. Rather, the
initial sanction needs to be considered more as information both to the
person who is &#8220;caught&#8221; and to others in the community. Rule infractions,
however, can generate a downward cascade of cooperation in a group that
relies only on conditional cooperation and has no capacity to sanction.
A real threat to the continuance of self-organized regimes occurs, however,
if some participants break rules repeatedly.</dd>
<dt><strong>resolution of conflicts</strong></dt>
<dd>the importance of access to rapid, low-cost, local arenas to resolve
conflict among users or between users and officials. Also, mechanisms to
clarify, discuss and resolve the rules and the infractions are necessary.</dd>
<dt><strong>legislative recognition</strong></dt>
<dd>The capability of local users to develop an ever-more effective regime over time
is affected by whether they have minimal recognition of the right to organize by a
national or local government. (unanimity vs non-unanimity)</dd>
<dt><strong>the presence of governance activities</strong></dt>
<dd>When common pool resources are somewhat larger, an eighth design
principle tends to characterize successful systems-the presence of governance
activities organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises.</dd>

<h2>Threats to Sustained Collective Action<a class="headerlink" href="#threats-to-sustained-collective-action" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here we will concentrate on
those factors that affect the distribution of types of participants within a regime and
the strength of the norms of trust and reciprocity held by participants.</p>
<p>Major migration (out of or into an area) is always a threat that may or may not
be countered effectively. Out-migration may change the economic viability of a
regime due to loss of those who contribute needed resources. In-migration may
bring new participants who do not trust others and do not rapidly learn social
norms that have been established over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Other exogenous and endogenous factors identified by the literature: 1) efforts
by national governments to impose a single set of rules on all governance units
in a region; 2) rapid changes in technology, in factor availability, and in
reliance on monetary transactions; 3) transmission failures from one generation
to the next of the operational principles on which self-organized governance is
based; 4) turning to external sources of help too frequently; 5) international
aid that does not take account of indigenous knowledge and institutions; 6)
growth of corruption and other forms of opportunistic behavior; and 7) a lack of
large-scale institutional arrangements that provide fair and low-cost resolution
mechanisms for conflicts.</p>
