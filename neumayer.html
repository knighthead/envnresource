<h1>On the Methodology of ISEW, GPI and related measures<a class="headerlink" href="#on-the-methodology-of-isew-gpi-and-related-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>some constructive suggestions and some doubt on the &#8216;threshold&#8217; hypothesis</em></p>
<p>by Eric Neumayer (2000), in Ecological Economics, (34) 347-361.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the 1990s, the construction of an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare
(ISEW) has become quite popular. The computation starts from personal
consumption expenditures weighted with an index of income inequality. Then
certain welfare relevant factors are added (e.g. household labour) and certain
welfare-relevant losses are subtracted (e.g. cost of environmental pollution,
costs of depletion of non-renewable resources and long-term environmental damage
costs). The index has been criticised by some authors, but in the paper Neumayer
aspires to put forward some constructive suggestions. He addresses three items:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the valuation of the depletion of non-renewable resources</li>
<li>the valuation of long-term environmental damage</li>
<li>the adjustment of consumption expenditures for income inequality</li>
</ul>
<p>Proponents of the ISEW/GPI indices have put great emphasis on a clearly
discernible trend of the ISEW/GPI in almost all studies undertaken so far:
starting from around the 1970s or early 1980s depending on the country, the
ISEW/GPI no longer rises very much or even falls, whereas GNP continues to rise.
As an explanation for this widening gap between the two indicators, Max-Neef has
put forward the so-called &#8216;threshold hypothesis&#8217;: for every society there seems
to be a period in which economic growth (as conventionally measured) brings
about an improvement in the quality of life, but only up to a point - the
threshold point - beyond which, if there is more economic growth, quality of
life may begin to deteriorate. The paper argues that proponents of ISEW/GPI
consider their results too easily as evidence for the &#8216;threshold hypothesis&#8217;. It
suggests that as far as depletion of non-renewable resources and long-term
environmental damage contribute to the widening gap between ISEW/GPI and GNP,
this gap might be the artefact of highly contestable methodolical assumptions.</p>

<div class="section" id="depletion-of-non-renewable-resources">
<h2>Depletion of non-renewable resources<a class="headerlink" href="#depletion-of-non-renewable-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 different aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>replacement costs</strong></p>
<p>The rational for using this one: It stems from the idea that non-renewable
resource use, which cannot be prolonged forever and is therefore, not
sustainable into the indefinite future, would have to be replaced by
renewable resources.</p>
<p>2 major problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the underlying assumption is that non-renewable resource use has to be
fully replaced by renewable resources in the present (if there are still
available resources today that are cheaper, why fully replace them?)</li>
<li>the escalation factor assumes that replacement costs increase over time
(reason behind: when the limits of a resource are being reached, the
cost of extracting the next unit is more costly than the previous unit’
and that ‘this principle presumably applies also to renewable fuels,
although to a lesser extent - BUT: the cost of solar technology is
expected to decrease, this falling costs should be more proper to be
assumed)</li>
</ul>
<p>If replacement costs are not assumed to escalate by 3% per annum, no
widening gap between ISEW and GNP.</p>
<p>Furthermore, methodologically correct would be the valuation of resource
consumption, not extraction, since the rational behind this method is to
replace non-renewable resource use (the source of the resource is
irrelevant).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>resource rents</strong></p>
<p>The rationale for using this method: because non-renewable resources are
irreversibly lost in the process of use, non-renewable resource extraction
represents the (partial) liquidation of an existing capital stock. Rental
income that accrues from resrouces extraction is, therefore non-sustainable
into the future and should either fully (total resource rent) or partly
(resource user cost) be deduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">if total resource rent is used: <strong>total resource rent vs resource user cost</strong>
(calculated with the El Serafy method) (the latter is onyl a fraction of
the former)</p>
<p>El Serafy method: calculates the differences between two streams: (1) finite
stream from the non-renewable resource, (2) infinite but lower level of the
substitute renewable resource. Thus this method takes into account that by
investing the income from non-renewable resources an infinite income from
renewable can be sustained.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="long-term-environmental-damage">
<h2>Long-term environmental damage<a class="headerlink" href="#long-term-environmental-damage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the initial approach to ISEW/GPI, the annual nonrenwable energy resource
consumption is valued at: $0.5 in 1972 dollars and this value is deduced from
the ISEW in this year but also in all following years. The rationale behind is:
&#8220;the funds from a $0.5 tax on a barrel equivalent non-renewable resource could
be set aside to accumulate in a non-interest-bearing account, which would be
available to compensate future generations for the long-term damage caused by
the use of fossil fuels and atomic energy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Accumulation in the UK ISEW study is theoretically incorrect: In valuing each
tonne of emissions with its marginal social cost, the total future damage of
this tonne of emissions is already valued. To let this value accumulate over
time is self-contradictory and therefore simply wrong as it leads to multiple
counting of the total future damage.</p>
<p>In the initial approach as well, accumulation leads to multiple counting,
because money for the damage caused by each unit of emissions is set aside not
only in the year of emission, but for each subsequent year as well.</p>
<p>Not assuming accumulation of the environmental damage yields no discrepancy
between ISEW and GNP, but &#8220;One might think that even if long-term environmental
damage is not accumulated over time, a threshold effect might still arise if
marginal social costs per tonne of emitted carbon are assumed to increase over
time&#8221;. But at least for the UK ISEW, the only study so far using rising marginal
social costs, the threshold effect fails to materialise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adjustment-for-inequality">
<h2>Adjustment for inequality<a class="headerlink" href="#adjustment-for-inequality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Atkinson index should be used since using this the researcher has to
explicitly state his/her assumption on society&#8217;s aversion to income inequality.
The adjusting index generated by the Gini coefficients is very ad hoc and the
researchers assumption is not explicitly explicated (base year chosen for the
index).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ISEW/GPI can not be directly compared to GNP. If ISEW/GPI is
interpreted as an index, only the changes can are meaningful, the levels are
not. If it is interpreted as an absolute measure, then a clear statement is
needed on the base year. Related to this point, the ISEW/GPI needs to be
interpreted as a measure of welfare, not as sustainable or Hicksian income.
Amongst other things, this is because, due to the indexing, the resulting
ISEW:GPI cannot be interpreted as the income that society can safely consume and
be as well off at the end of the year as at the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>(Main conclusion of the above mentioned +)</p>
<p>It has been shown that if no escalation factor is applied to valuing the
depletion of non-renewable resources, and if long-term environmental damage is
not accumulated, then none of these items contributes any longer to a widening
gap between ISEW:GPI and GNP. One can therefore conclude from the analysis above
that variables related to the environment do not provide evidence for the
‘threshold hypothesis‘. This does not provide sufficient evidence against the
‘threshold hypothesis’ in general, as other factors covered by ISEW/GPI
might still create a widening, but smaller, gap between ISEW/GPI and GNP/GDP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="questions">
<h2>Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Based on the method used to calculate the index, it is implicitly assumed
that physical capital is a good substitute for natural capital. If we take
a broader definition of natural capital that includes ecosystem services
(which are an essential part of sustainability), does this assumption seem
to be plausible?</p>
<p>If the costs of using the non-renewable resource are compensated at the
moment by increased economic activity and if we do not assume the
accumulation of environmental costs, does this mean substitutability and
sustainability?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">With this extended definition, if we assume that physical capital can
replace ecosystem services (e.g. climate control, water purification or
soil formation) only for a limited extend, does the assumption of falling
replacement costs seem to be right?</p>
</li>
