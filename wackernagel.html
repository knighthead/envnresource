<h1>Perpetual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital<a class="headerlink" href="#perpetual-and-structural-barriers-to-investing-in-natural-capital" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>Economics from an ecological footprint perspective</em></p>
<p>by Mathis Wackernagel, William E. Rees (1997) in Ecological Economics (20) 3-24.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-natural-capital-as-appropriated-carrying-capacity">
<h2>Introduction: natural capital as appropriated carrying capacity<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-natural-capital-as-appropriated-carrying-capacity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The paper argues that perceptual distortions and prevailing economic
rationality, far from encouraging investment in natural capital, actually
accelerate the depletion of natural capital stocks. THe paper builds on a more
ecologically complete definition that would include not only all the biophysical
resources and waste sinks needed to support the human economy, but also the
relationship among those entities and processes that provide life support to the
ecosphere (e.g. the fish stock is the natural capital, the sustainable harvest
is natural income). Natural capital is the totality of renewable and
non-renewable natural capital, and this paper uses a biophysical approach to
aggregate its various forms. Thus natural capital is not just an inventory of
resources; it includes all those components of the ecospehere and the structural
relationships among them, whose organizational integrity is essential for the
continuous self-production of the system itself.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-constant-capital-stocks-criterion">
<h3>The constant capital stocks criterion<a class="headerlink" href="#the-constant-capital-stocks-criterion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The authors subscribe to the precautionary principle that each generation should
inherit a stock of essential biophysical asset alone no less that the stock of
such assets inherited by the previous generation. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> This interpretation
emphasizes ecological necessity, particularly the life-support functions of
self-producing biophysical capital. Emphasis is on the pragmatic minimal
biophysical requirements for humane survival. On the other hand, the
preservation of biophysical assets essential to humankind does imply the direct
protection of whole ecosystems and thousands of keystone species, and thousands
more will benefit indirectly from the maintenance of the same systems upon which
humans are dependent.</p>
<p>The next steps are to determine how to best measure constancy of natural
capital, or in other words, how the various forms of natural capital can be
aggregated. Using money values as measure of natural capital constancy is
misleading from an ecological perspective precisely because a constant (or
increasing) dollar value of a resource stock can result from the physical
depletion of the stock (and its functions). Monetary measure can foster the
illusion of constant stocks while physical inventories actually shrink. More
fundamentally, prices can say nothing all about non-market, but ecologically
essential, stocks and processes (e.g. the ozone layer and photosynthetic CO2
uptake), nor about those ecosystem functions whose value to humankind is not
revealed until they are in jeopardy or disappear.</p>
<p>To summarize, an economy depends on natural capital to provide all the resource
flows and waste sinks necessary to sustain a given material standard of living,
while simultaneously maintaining the functional integrity and productivity of
the stocks themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ecological-footprint-and-appropriated-carrying-capacity">
<h3>The ecological footprint and appropriated carrying capacity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ecological-footprint-and-appropriated-carrying-capacity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first approximation, the ecological footprint can be represented as the
aggregate area of land and water in various ecological categories that is
claimed by participants in that economy to produce all the resources they
consume, and to absorb all their wastes they generate on a continuous basis,
using prevailing technology. Evidently, the area of the footprint depends on the
population size, material living standards, technology and ecological
productivity.</p>
<p>It is useful to think of the essential self-producing natural capital
represented by an economy&#8217;s ecological footprint as &#8216;Hicksian natural capital.&#8217;
Hicksian income is the level of consumption that can be sustained from one
period to the next without reducing wealth. In the present context this
corresponds to &#8216;natural income.&#8217; For a given economy, the Hicksian natural
capital would therefore be the aggregate natural capital stocks necessary to
sustain this economy&#8217;s ecological flows (natural income) and consumption
patterns indefinitely.</p>
<p>Estimates of the ecological footprint and appropriated carrying capacity provide
clear direction for action. THey indicate whether current or projected
consumption levels can be sustained by available ecological productivity. the
ecological footprint becomes a useful yardstick for sustainability. As the
ecological footprint of humanity needs to be smaller than the available carrying
capacity, it becomes an absolute benchmark. It also points out how the
ecological footprint can be reduced: through lower population, lower
consumption, more efficient technologies (as long as gains are not re-spent),
higher ecological productivity, or a combination of these four parameters.</p>
<p>Rough calculations suggest that the ecological footprint of all industrialized nations, representing less than 20% of the world population, is larger than the available ecologically productive land on Earth. The data indicate that it is simply not possible, ecologically or thermodynamically, for everybody in the world to consume at current industrial levels without risking irreversible resource depletion and ecospheric collapse.</p>

<h2>A taxonomy of barriers to investing in natural capital<a class="headerlink" href="#a-taxonomy-of-barriers-to-investing-in-natural-capital" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the unquestioned monetary value of many ecological goods and the fact that
certain ecological services are essential for life, why does humankind not even
maintain, let alone invest, in natural capital stocks?</p>
<p>Four main classes of reasons are identified:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Ignorance, fundamental beliefs and denial</em>:</dt>
<dd>Decision-makers understand neither the nature of the problem nor the crucial
role of natural capital stocks. Others who do understnad are in denial, or
are unwilling or incapable of taking necessary action.</dd>
<dt><em>Economic abstraction, deviant operating models and knowledge</em>:</dt>
<dd>Socio-economic abstractions are barriers to investment in natural capital
because they bear little relation to ecological reality.</dd>
<dt><em>The social mimicry of individual rationality</em>:</dt>
<dd>A global economic regime is being created in which what has become accepted as <cite>rational</cite> economic behaviour by individuals is ever more being emulated
at higher organizational scales at the expense of public goods and communal
values.</dd>
<dt><em>Physical and structural manifestations of modern society</em>:</dt>
<dd>The pysical separation between consumption and production, further reliance
on electronic media rather than direct experience, the fast-paced
integration of the global economy, energy intensive settlements
infrastructure and the loss of local political autonomy reduce corrective
feedback for the maintenance of natural capital and amplify the dilemma
between economic expansion and ecological integrity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reality today is that much deterioration of the global &#8216;commons&#8217; can be
attributed to the unforeseen consequences of deliberate policies that extend
self-interested individualistic behaviour and rights to government and
inter-overnment agencies, transnational corporations, and various other
multinational organizations operating in the global arena. Examples include
international agreements for the division and exploitation of the sea-bed and
similar &#8216;undeveloped&#8217; common-pool resources.</p>
<p>Current global development models implicitly assume an infinite world.
Unfortunately, the real world is finite and the invisible hand of the market has
nothing to say about the appropriate scale fo an entropic economy operating
under such a constraint.</p>
<p>To argue that globalism and self-interested individual behavior is a dominant
factor in the depletion of natural capital is to underscore a particularly
pernicious form of market failure. In a finite, materially-closed system like
the ecosphere, the competitive forces guiding the invisible hand become
positively destructive. Not all individuals, corporations, and nations can
simultaneously maximize their individual use of global sources and sinks without
over-exploiting or destroying the common-pool life-support functions that are
fessential to their mutual survival. It is conceivable that some market failures
actually reduce natural capital depletion by compromising an economy&#8217;s aggregate
purchasing power and reducing material consumption.</p>

<h2>Exploring four issues in more detail<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-four-issues-in-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="marginal-pricing-and-economic-valuation">
<h3>Marginal pricing and economic valuation<a class="headerlink" href="#marginal-pricing-and-economic-valuation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The beauty - as well as the danger - of market prices is that they seem to maker
resoruces commensurate, enabling us to trade apples for oranges. It reveals only
what people are willing to pay today for the next unit of that commodity. This
price is influenced by many things including total income, available
alternatives (opportunity costs) and current fashion. Accordingly, market
pricing can often equate the terminally frivolous to the absolutely essential.</p>
<p>If we value bioproductivity only by its dollar price at the margin, we are
completely misled about the magnitude of nature&#8217;s contribution to human welfare.
However, these figures reflect neither the necessity for agriculture nor its
true relative worth compared to the information sector.</p>
<p>In short, marginal prices for the products of natural capital convey a sense
that nature&#8217;s total value is finite, when, in fact, ecological necessity
dictates that the total social utility of many forms of natural capital is
infinite: without water, no life; without air, no life; without photosynthesis,
no life, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interregional-risk-pooling">
<h3>Interregional risk pooling<a class="headerlink" href="#interregional-risk-pooling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally, economist argue that risk-pooling is beneficial to individuals and,
therefore, also for society. If individuals are too risk-averse, they miss
opportunities, misallocate resources, or under-consume. However, pooling risks
can have ecological draw-backs.</p>
<p>For example, coastal communities whose survival is dependent on traditional
fisheries generally evolve harvest strategies that conserve fish stocks. Only
when they acquire the option of pooling risks with the outside through accessing
other regions&#8217; carrying capacity and moving their capital elsewhere do they
adopt more aggressive fishing strategies that could lead to resource exhaustion.
Having access to others&#8217; resources effectively reduces the perceived present
value of local natural capital. Because extinction of the local stock no longer
immediately endangers survival or the local economy, it may even make economic
sense to exploit that stock unsustainably and to invest the returns in a more
profitable venture elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trade-and-limiting-factors">
<h3>Trade and limiting factors<a class="headerlink" href="#trade-and-limiting-factors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is apparent that natural capital is once again more likely to impose limits
on the scale of economy than are labour shortages. This makes the ecological
&#8216;Law of Minimum&#8217; and the concept of appropriated carrying capacity essential to
any interpretation of the sustainability implications of international trade.
The &#8216;Law of Minimum&#8217;, that systems and processes are governed by that single
necessary factor in the last supply, led to the use of more specific fertilizers
in agriculture. Howeverm there are ecological drawbacks. In nature, limiting
factors serve inadvertently to regulate production systems. THe shortage of
only one essential requirement prevents plant growth from exhausting the entire
resource base. The effect of chemical fertilization, therefore, is to accelerate
the depletion of successive components of the soil, a potentially renwable
form of natural capital, while creating dependencies on non-renewable,
manufactured capital.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unregualted trade acts like excessive fertilizer: it can
short-circuit ecological fuses which historically kept economic throughput in
balance with local bioproductivity. Most economists explicitly support
unrestricted trade precisely because it enables local economies to overcome
any material barriers to growth. The growth of economies most likely entails
higher populations, greater resources throughputs, accelerated stock depletion,
and intensified pollution. The questions is, at what point do their people
cease being better off than before? Each economy is still contained by a second
limiting factor, and in addition is now dependent on an essential resource
supplied by another economy. TO this extent the gains are only transitional:
a short period of economic growth during which distributional conflicts are
eased.</p>
<p>Global economic integration have ecological consequences: (1) material growth
anywhere nefverssarily increases the throughput of energy and matrial
resources, including those which have not historically been limiting; (2) it
exposes all local resoruce stocks to the largest possible market; (3) trade acts
as a special case of risk-pooling.</p>
<p>The net effect is becoming self-evident in the modern world. Surplus&#8217; natural
capital stocks everywhere are drawn down and global sinks are filled to
over-flowing. Our global safety net is being shredded as the &#8216;Tragedy of the
Commons&#8217; is played out on a global scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="efficiency">
<h3>Efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#efficiency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many economists and environmentalists believe that advances in technological
efficieny is a potential panacea for the global crisis. As effective as
theses trategies might seem on the micro sale, however, increasing the ratio
between output and input does not necessarily lead to lower resource use. On the
contrary, technological efficiency may actually lead to increased net
consumption of resources. Lester Brown et al. (1991, 81) states that &#8220;continuing
growth in material consumption will eventually overwhelm gains from efficiency,
causing total resource use to rice&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">On the micro-level:</p>
<p>imroved energy or material efficiency may enable firms to raise wages,
increase dividens, or lower prices, all of which may lead to higher net
consumption. Similarly, technology-induced savings by individuals are
usually redrected to other forms of consumption, canceling some of the
initial gain.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On the meso (or regional) level:</p>
<p>The money for both the energy-saving equipment as well as the amounts
saved through improved energy efficiency will more likely be spent locally,
thus stimulating the local economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On the macro-level:</p>
<p>Empirical &#8220;results imply that the link between economic activity and energy
use is stronger than believed by most neoclassical economists.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">technical innovation:</p>
<p>&#8220;energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means:
(1) by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs; (2)
by increasing economic growth, which pull up energy use.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">technical efficiency:</p>
<p>Profitable efficiency gains contribute to upward-trending expectations
of returns to capital, accelerated growth, and increased demand for
resources. Overall, innovation stimulated by competition generally
accelerates global economic performance and with it, entropic throughput.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Efficiency gains far from conserving natural capital or decreasing
footprints leads to higher consumption.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Implications for investing in natural capital<a class="headerlink" href="#implications-for-investing-in-natural-capital" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Only with economic theories that are grounded in an understanding of biophysical
flows, and of stocks necessary to secure these flows, will we be able to accept
the economic necessity to invest in natural capital, and by that maintain its
capacity. The question then becomes how we will be able to provide these basic
securities for human survival. We face a difficult choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Either we continue on our current path:</p>
<p>which is bad: prevailing econmic logic and development strategies discourage
investment in natural capital (they reinfroce the primacy of human-made
capital over natural capital because the former &#8216;reproduces&#8217; faster than the
latter). Investment has become the opposite of conservation and ultimately
threatens human welfare. People everywhere are faced with a complex
paradox: the dominant strategy promises to enhance human welfare, but
increasingly seems responsible for eroding it.</p>
