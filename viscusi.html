<ul>
<li><p class="first">Value of statistical lives</p>
<p>What is that person&#8217;s willingness to pay to eliminate some small risk
of death? (WTP of those affected by the risk reduction in the context of
policies)</p>
<p>This is appropriate for deterrence rather than compensation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Insurance and human capital measures</p>
<p>The present value of the earnings of the individual exposed to the risk.</p>
<p>This measure is more appropriate for insurance and compensation to the
accident victim.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Make Whole Principle</p>
<p>Make the victim &#8220;whole&#8221; after an economic loss by compensating for the
value of the loss that has been incurred. This approach not only provides
for full compensation of the loss but also establishes appropriate
incentives for accident avoidance in situations in which all accident
losses are monetary. [...] Optimal insurance will provide for sufficient
compensation to equate the marginal utililty of income in both the
accident and the marginal utility of income in both the accident and the
no accident state of the world.</p>
<p>[...] If there is no such diminution in marginal utility, then the total
value of the compensation an accident victim receives for the financial
loss plus any pain and suffering compensation should be sufficient to make
the victim whole.</p>
<p>[...] There is consequently no economic justification for levels of
postaccident insruance compensation that will restore the fatally injured
or seriously impaired accident victims to their preaccident welfare level.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Risk-Risk analysis</p>
<p>Regulations may create risks as well as reduce them. In some cases, there
may be direct risk effects of the regulation. &#8220;Risks caused by regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Health-health analysis [based on this](<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457501000847">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457501000847</a>): Expenditure
on a particular health policy or safety regulation must be financed in one way
or another, which will results in an opportunity cost or income effect leaving
less resources for other health and safety promoting activities in society.
Thus, we will have an effect that reduxces safety and health benefits induced
by that income loss. [...] One way of esimating the income loss that induces
one death, which we call the value of an induced death (VOID), is to estimate
it as a multiple of the traditional value to acert a statistical death, also
named the value of a statistical life (VOSL).</p>

<h2>Value of statistical lives<a class="headerlink" href="#value-of-statistical-lives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supposed that we had 10,000 respondents, each of whom faced a 1/10,000 risk of
death. Overall, there would be one statistical death expected in this group. If
each person is willing to pay $500 to eliminate the risk, a total of $5 million
coould be raised to eliminate the one statistical death to the entire group. Thus,
$5 million would be the value of a statistical life in this situation.</p>
<p>[...] Smith suggested that workers would need to be compensated for jobs that posed
additional risk; otherwise, these positions would not be as attractive as safer job
alternatives. - Graphical example on the trade off of the wage and risk of a job.
(XX curve - from the market optimums vs. individual preferences - they provide
different risk compensation rates for a given person)</p>

<h2>Regulatory Applications of the Value of Life<a class="headerlink" href="#regulatory-applications-of-the-value-of-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Office of Management and Budget now recommends the use of the value of
life methodology for benefit assessment for all proposed federal regulations. While
agencies now routinely assess benefits using these value of life figures, the result of
the analysis do not always bind government policy. In most instances, the restrictive
legislative mandates of the regulatory agencies require that they issues protective
regulations irrespective of benefit-cost balancing. [...] The different cost per life
for U.S. policies.</p>
<p>### Salient policy issues</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in the value of life should be incorporated in the calculations as well
given the context of the regulations. Value of life may differ based on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>individual age: the value of the years that are gained because of the risk
reduction differs on the actual age.</li>
<li>income: WTP is different for different income groups (however, government imposed
distinctions would be controversial - a consumer borne solution would be more fit)</li>
<li>quality of life years at risk and the whether the risks are voluntary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As the paper points out, the value of statistical life can be different if ceteris
paribus the income is different. This would mean that the same policy reducing
the health issues from environment degradation by tackling the pollution can be
efficient based on a cost-benefit analysis in a developed country while not
efficient in a developing country. Does this mean that the value of the environment
is lower in the developing country than in the developed country?</li>
<li>Given this problem and that these calculations based on the value statistical life
(WTP) are susceptible to underestimate future generations valuations (as described
in the paper) is it rational for the US. regulatory bodies to issue protective
regulations regardless the implications of the cost-benefit analyses?</li>
